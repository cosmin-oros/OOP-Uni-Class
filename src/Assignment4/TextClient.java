/*
    2 (optional). Define a class called Text that contains maximum 20 words
    and for each word a number that keeps track of how many times the
    corresponding word appeared in the text is stored.
    The class provides two services for:
    • adding a word
    - if 20 words were already added this service fails (the method returns
    false)
    - if the word has already been stored, the associated number is
    incremented by 1
    - if the word has not been added, it is stored and the associated
    number is 1
    • printing the text: each word is printed together with its number of
    occurrences in the text.
    Create a class TextClient with a main method for exemplifying the
    functionalities provided by the Text class.
